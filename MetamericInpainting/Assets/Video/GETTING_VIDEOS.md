# Getting Videos

This 360 RGBD videos used in our video example were originally included with the demo of Motion Parallax for 360 RGBD Video (Serrano et al. TVCG 2019)

Their demo is available on Github here: https://github.com/ana-serrano/VR-6dof, and a series of suitable videos are included here: https://github.com/ana-serrano/VR-6dof/tree/master/6dof_demo_exe/vids

For this demo only the colour and depth videos are required (e.g. `cafeteria.mp4` and `cafeteria_depth.mp4`). These can be added to the `VideoPlayer`s in the `Color` and `Depth` GameObjects in the `InpaintingCamerasEquiVideoSmooth` prefab.
